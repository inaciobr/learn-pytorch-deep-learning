# 05. PyTorch Going Modular

This directory contains materials for section [05. PyTorch Going Modular](https://www.learnpytorch.io/05_pytorch_going_modular/).

They breakdown as follows:
* `going_modular/` - directory of Python helper scripts for running PyTorch code.
* `models/` - trained PyTorch models that come as a result of running notebook 05. Going Modular Part 1 and Part 2.
* `05_pytorch_going_modular_cell_mode.ipynb` - Part 1/2 notebooks for teaching the materials for section 05. This notebook takes the most useful code from notebook 04 and streamlines it.
* `05_pytorch_going_modular_script_mode.ipynb` - Part 2/2 notebooks for teaching the materials for section 05. This notebooks turns the most useful code cells from Part 1 into the Python scripts contained in `going_modular/`.
