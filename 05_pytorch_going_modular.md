# TODO: Going modular

In this section we turn notebook 04 into a series of Python scripts saved to `going_modular`.

This document will describe those steps.

Afterwards we can reuse the same code in the scripts in the next notebook (06), Transfer Learning.

Pros:
* Saves a lot of rewriting code
* Good idea to: start in notebooks then move to scripts when you've got something working.
