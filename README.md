# Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning (work in progress)

I'd like to learn PyTorch. So I'm going to use this repo to:

1. Add what I've learned.
2. Teach others in a beginner-friendly way.

Stay tuned to here for updates, course materials are being actively worked on.

Launch early-mid 2022.

## Course materials/outline

* **Note:** This is rough and subject to change.
* **Course focus:** `code, code, code, experiment, experiment, experiment`

### Old outline version (will update this if necessary)

0. PyTorch fundamentals - ML is all about representing data as numbers (tensors) and manipulating those tensors so this module will cover PyTorch tensors.
1. PyTorch workflow - You'll use different techniques for different problem types but the workflow remains much the same:
```
data -> build model -> fit model to data (training) -> evaluate model and make predictions (inference) -> save & load model
```
Module 1 will showcase an end-to-end PyTorch workflow that can be leveraged for other problems.

2. PyTorch classification - Let's take the workflow we learned in module 1 and apply it to a common machine learning problem type: classification (deciding whether something is one thing or another).
3. PyTorch computer vision - We'll get even more specific now and see how PyTorch can be used for computer vision problems though still using the same workflow from 1 & 2. We'll also start functionizing the code we've been writing, for example: `def train(model, data, optimizer, loss_fn): ...`
4. PyTorch custom datasets - How do you load a custom dataset into PyTorch? Also we'll be laying the foundations in this notebook for our modular code (covered in 05).
5. Going modular - PyTorch is designed to be modular, let's turn what we've created into a series of Python scripts (this is how you'll often find PyTorch code in the wild). For example:
```
code/
    data_setup.py <- sets up data
    model_builder.py <- builds the model ready to be used
    engine.py <- training/eval functions for the model
    train.py <- trains and saves the model
```
6. PyTorch transfer learning - Let's improve upon the models we've built ourselves using transfer learning.
7. PyTorch experiment tracking - We've built a bunch of models... wouldn't it be good to track how they're all going?
8. PyTorch paper replicating - Let's see why PyTorch is the most popular deep learning framework for machine learning research by replicating a machine learning research paper with it.
9. PyTorch model deployment - How do you get your PyTorch models in the hands of others?

Each notebook will teach a maximum of 3 big ideas.
